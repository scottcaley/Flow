This is not a complete readme file. I'm typing this up right before I submit this to Applied Optimization for anybody who wants to play around with this program.

Currently, game dimensions can be adjusted in Flow.cs. A test file path can be added there too (dimensions still need to be manually adjusted for them).

The controls are as follows:
E + click: place endpoint (remember to place the other)
B + click: place bridge
G + click: place 'gone' (delete tile)
W + click: place wall
P + click: place or rotate portal (remember to place the other)
Space: solve (can be sped up by powers of 2 with the digit keys)
Z: undo (can be sped up by powers of 2 with the digit keys)
F: finish (solve as fast as possible)
